# Automated Question Paper Generation Using AI & Bloom’s Taxonomy

## Project Overview

The Automated Question Paper Generation System is an AI-based educational tool designed to assist educators in creating examination question papers efficiently. The system generates questions automatically based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, subject topics, and difficulty levels, ensuring balanced cognitive assessment and reducing manual effort.

## Objectives

- Automate the exam question paper creation process
- Apply Bloom’s Taxonomy for cognitive-level classification
- Generate questions with controlled difficulty levels
- Produce automatic answer keys
- Provide analytical reports on question distribution

## User Flow (Example)

1. Teacher logs into the system
2. Selects a subject (e.g., DBMS)
3. Chooses relevant topics (Normalization, ER Model)
4. Specifies:
   - Bloom’s Taxonomy levels
   - Difficulty level
5. Generates the question paper
6. Reviews the paper, answer key, and analytical report

## Key Features

- Automated question paper generation
- Bloom’s Taxonomy–based classification
- Difficulty-level control
- Support for multiple question types
- Automatic answer key generation
- Analytical reports for evaluation

## System Architecture (Conceptual)

The system follows a layered architecture consisting of:

- User Interface Layer
- Application Logic Layer
- AI Processing Layer
- Data Management Layer

This structure ensures clear separation of responsibilities and scalability.

## Sample Output

**Question:**  
Explain Third Normal Form (3NF) with an example.

**Classification:**

- Bloom’s Level: Understand
- Difficulty: Medium
